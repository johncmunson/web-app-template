# README

## Todos

- Circle back to `web-app/package.json`. Might be able to remove a lot of the radix deps. Also...
  - Many of the imports need changed to reference the `ui` workspace.
  - Many of the `shadcn` components need migrated to the `ui` workspace.
- Consider adding storybook capability to the `ui` workspace

## Misc

- Write a _Monorepo Guidelines and Best Practices_ doc so there's a clear mental model of how to add new packages and manage their dependencies
