The purpose of this project is to be a solid starter template for a modern Next.js app router project. The tech stack includes:

- Frontend: Next.js (app router)
- Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL in local dev, Neon in production)
- Authentication: better-auth
- Deployment Target: Vercel

The core tech stack is intentionally kept minimal to allow for flexibility and easy customization. Additional libraries and tools may be added to this starter template in the future based on user feedback and requirements.

A goal of this project is to not only establish boilerplate setup and configuration, but to also build out common features and workflows that are typically needed in modern web applications. This includes:

- User authentication flows (e.g., sign up, sign in, sign out, password reset, etc.)
- User authorization and role-based access control
- User profile management
- Transactional email setup (e.g., welcome emails, password resets)
- CRUD operations for a sample resource (e.g., posts, tasks)
- Responsive design and accessibility best practices
- Error handling and notifications
- Testing setup and example tests (e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright)
- CI/CD configuration for automated deployments
- Environment variable management
- Documentation and code comments for clarity
- Example GitHub Actions workflows
- SEO optimization and performance best practices
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- State management setup (e.g., React Context, Zustand, or Redux)
- API integration examples (e.g., fetching data from an external API)
- Form handling and validation (e.g., React Server Functions + Zod)
- Image optimization and handling (e.g., using Next.js Image component)
- Analytics integration (e.g., PostHog)
- Webhooks setup and examples
- Real-time features (e.g., Pusher)
- File uploads and management
- Rate limiting and security best practices
- Logging and monitoring setup (e.g., using Sentry or LogRocket)

This project is rapidly evolving. Please check back frequently for updates and new features.
