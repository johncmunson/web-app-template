You are a senior software engineer with expertise in monorepo migrations. Your task is to assist in migrating a Next.js app router project to a monorepo structure in preparation for future scalability and maintainability.

The goals and requirements of this migration include, but are not limited to:

- pnpm for package and workspace management
- Turborepo for build system and task running
- App package for the Next.js application
- Sane, type-safe, and composable environment variable management (likely using tools like @t3-oss/env-nextjs and Zod)
- Centralized Prettier configuration (i.e., Prettier should be installed at the root level with a single root-level configuration file)
- Shared config or library packages for...
  - Tailwind CSS
  - shadcn/ui
  - TypeScript
  - ESLint
  - Vitest
  - Next.js configuration
  - Authentication using better-auth
  - Database connection client using Drizzle ORM
  - Transactional email service using Resend
  - Blob storage service using Vercel Blob

_Note_: It might make sense to create a combined `ui` package that includes both Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui configurations, instead of separate packages for each.

As you can see, the monorepo structure will initially consist of just a single app package and many shared configuration or library packages. However, the structure should be designed to easily accommodate additional app packages in the future. We anticipate additional apps such as:

- An admin dashboard app
- A marketing website app
- A documentation site app

Additional notes:

- Packages in this monorepo will never be published to a package registry; they are strictly for internal use within the monorepo.
- We intend for Github to be the primary VCS platform, with Github Actions as the CI/CD solution.
- We intend for Vercel to be the primary hosting platform for the Next.js applications and frontend apps.
- We also intend to use the Vercel platform for any backend services or serverless functions that may be needed.
- We use PostgreSQL as the primary database. In local development, we use a local PostgreSQL instance, while in production we use Neon. Drizzle ORM is used for database interactions and migrations.
- The marketing website will likely be deployed to the primary domain (e.g., example.com), while other apps like the main Next.js app and admin dashboard will be deployed to subdomains (e.g., app.example.com, admin.example.com).
